= Requests =

Receiving estimate requests on your site is simplified with Sprout Invoices. Use the customizable default form or integrate with an existing form built a favorite form builder plugin, e.g. Gravity Forms or Ninja Forms.

= Estimating =

Estimates are automatically created based on estimate request submissions from your site. Review, update, and send the estimate to your new client without having to depend on communicating via email first.


= Invoicing =

Invoices are automatically generated from accepted estimates speeding up the process of getting paid. Sprout Invoices understands deposit payments and doesn't have the same hoops other invoice services require.


= Flexibility built in =

While Sprout Invoices automates many of the tasks to improve workflow the power comes from customization.

*Custom Estimate and Invoice Templates*
Estimates can be fully customized via a new theme template. If you're familiar with customizing a WordPress theme templates than you can create a custom estimate.

Notifications can be plain-text or HTML. Editing the entire content of a notification is simple with shortcodes that add dynamic content.

Over two hundred filters and actions allow you to hook into Sprout Invoices and alter whatever you'd like.
